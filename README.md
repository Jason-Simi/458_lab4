# 458 Lab 4 Map Design and Tile Generation

# Basemap
The first map depicts a basic basemap from mapbox using their monochrome dark theme. I then chose the greater seattle area of this map to be projected.

# Thematic Map
This map uses the Sky theme from Mapbox. This map is also overlayed with points that show the voting ballot boxes in the state of Washington with emphasis on the greater seattle area

# Thematic and Basemap
This map uses both the original dark basemap chosen from mapboxes selections and adds the layer that displays the voting ballot boxes.
